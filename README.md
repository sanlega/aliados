Alright, here is a structured architecture for your MQTT broker service, along with a PUB/SUB message structure:

**1. MQTT Topic Structure:**

For simplicity, and to easily identify different devices, each ESP32 device can be given a unique identifier. Here's a recommended topic structure:

1.1. **To Server (Publish by ESP32)**
- `aliados/device/{device_id}/status` - Sends status updates (e.g., activated, finished).
- `aliados/device/{device_id}/result` - Sends game results (player name, time to finish, retries, etc).

1.2. **From Server (Subscribed by ESP32)**
- `aliados/device/{device_id}/settings` - For changing settings on the device like max time or game loop iterations.

1.3. **From Control Panel (Publish by Webpage)**
- `aliados/control/start` - Signal to start the game/test.
- `aliados/control/stop` - Signal to stop or reset the game/test.
- `aliados/control/settings` - Publish settings to be subscribed by the server and then pushed to devices.

**2. MQTT Message Payloads:**

2.1. **To Server**
- Status update: `{"status": "activated"}` or `{"status": "finished"}`
- Results: `{"player_name": "John", "time_taken": "15:30", "retries": 3, "outcome": "success"}`

2.2. **From Server**
- Settings: `{"max_time": "20:00", "game_loops": 5}`

2.3. **From Control Panel**
- Start: `{"command": "start"}`
- Stop: `{"command": "stop"}`
- Settings: `{"max_time": "25:00", "game_loops": 7}`

**3. Docker Setup:**

3.1. **MQTT Broker (e.g., Mosquitto) Container**:
- This is the core of your system. 

3.2. **Backend Server Container**:
- Listens to MQTT topics and performs necessary logic.
- Stores results in a database.
- Pushes settings to ESP32 devices.

3.3. **Database Container** (e.g., SQLite for simplicity or PostgreSQL for more complexity):
- Store results of each game.
- Store device settings, if necessary.

3.4. **Frontend Web Application Container**:
- Allows user to interact with the service.
- Sends start, stop, and setting commands.
- Shows results and device statuses.

3.5. **MQTT Web Bridge Container** (Optional, for direct MQTT communication from the webpage):
- If you want the web application to communicate directly with the MQTT broker.

**4. Workflow:**

1. The control panel webpage is opened by the user. They can start or stop a game, or change settings.
2. ESP32 devices continuously publish their status to the MQTT broker.
3. The backend server listens to these statuses and stores results in the database.
4. The backend server listens for settings from the control panel and then forwards those settings to the ESP32 devices.
5. The webpage can also retrieve game results and display them to the user.

**5. Security:**

Ensure the MQTT broker is secured. Use username/password authentication or even client certificate authentication. Ensure that only trusted clients can publish or subscribe to critical topics.

Given the above architecture, you can start setting up each component, developing the necessary code for the backend server, and designing the control panel webpage.
